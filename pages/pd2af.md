# PD2AF Converter

[PD2AF converter](http://pd2af.me/) is designed to enable communication between the Process Description and the Activity Flow languages of the SBGN standard. The tool is build on the previously published template-based translation from PD to AF (Vogt et al., 2013, [doi: 10.1186/1752-0509-7-115](https://doi.org/10.1186/1752-0509-7-115)) implemented in the SBGN-ED addon of VANTED editor. The purpose of the new tool is to translate PD to AF in such a way so we can avoid using complexes in the resulting AF version and therefore be as close as possible to manually designed AF diagrams and the corresponding logical modles.

The coverter uses the concept of the SBGN Bricks and takes into account patterns of various types of inhibition.

The converter is written in Lisp programming language as it is well-suited for describing functional relationships in biological networks.

The project is led by the European Institute for Systems Biology and Medicine in collaboration with the Institute of Cell Biophysics, the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and the Bilkent University.
