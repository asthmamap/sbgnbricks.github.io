    <div class="text"><strong>Irreversible reaction.</strong> The activities of the enzyme and the substrate (S1) transform into the activity of the product (P1), shown by the use of the <i>positive influence</i> arc. Both substrate and product activities are marked by the <i>simple chemical</i> unit of information. The enzyme activity is represented using the <i>macromolecule</i> unit of information. <i>Logic arcs</i> resulting in the logical operator <i>AND</i> represent the necessity of the combined activities of S1 and enzyme </div>

    <div class="text"><strong>Irreversible reaction: multiple substrates.</strong> The activities of the enzyme and two substrate (S1 and S2) transform into the activity of the product (P1). All substrate and product activities are marked by the <i>simple chemical</i> unit of information. The enzyme activity is represented using the <i>macromolecule</i> unit of information. <i>Logic arcs</i> resulting in the logical operator <i>AND</i> represent the necessity of the combined activities of S1, S2 and enzyme </div>
